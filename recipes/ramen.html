    <p> This everyday meal is great for singles with some cooking experience; it may take longer than the overall time
        without cooking experience.</p>

    <h3 class="topic"> Ingredients </h3>

    <ul class="f1">
        <li> 1 large egg </li>

        <li> 1 ½ teaspoons spicy sesame oil

        <li> 2 (1x3-inch) boneless pork chop slices </li>

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided </li>

        <li>1 tablespoon black sesame seeds, divided </li>

        <li>2 leaves fresh basil, chopped, divided </li>

        <li> 1 leaf fresh sage, chopped, divided </li>

        <li>1 (3 ounce) package instant ramen noodles </li>

        <li> 3 tablespoons shredded dried kombu </li>

        <li> 1 ¾ tablespoons bonito soup stock (such as Hondashi®) </li>

        <li>1 ¾ tablespoons soy sauce (shoyu) </li>

        <li> ½ teaspoon white miso paste with dashi</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="topic"> Steps </h3>
    <ol class="f1">
        <li> Fill a small pot halfway with water. Bring to a boil; add egg and cook in boiling water for 15 minutes.
            Drain. Run cold water over egg and set aside to cool.</li>

        <li> Pour sesame oil into a large skillet. Lay pork slices in oil. Cover pork with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2
            tablespoon sesame seeds, 1/2 of the basil, and 1/2 of the sage. Flip and cover pork with these remaining
            ingredients: 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, basil, and sage.</li>

        <li> Cook pork, covered, over medium-low heat, until evenly browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip and
            continue cooking until second side is browned, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat.</li>

        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook ramen noodles in boiling water until tender, about 3 minutes.
            Drain in a colander set in the sink; rinse noodles until water runs clear. Return noodles to the pot.</li>

        <li> Stir kombu, bonito stock, soy sauce, and miso paste into noodles. Cook, stirring with chopsticks, over
            medium heat, until miso paste is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer noodles to a serving bowl.</li>

        <li> Peel and cut egg in half lengthwise. Place egg, pork slices, and fish paste slices over noodles. Garnish
            with tonkatsu sauce, ginger, green onion, and black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
