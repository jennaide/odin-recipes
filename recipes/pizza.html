    <h2 class="topic"> Description </h2>

    <p> A cheesy casserole with all of your favorite pizza toppings. I like to serve this with a salad and garlic bread.
        The leftovers are great. I have prepared this in advance and then taken it to potlucks in a slow cooker the next
        day.</p>

    <h3 class="topic"> Ingredients </h3>

    <ul>
        <li> 1 pound ground beef </li>

        <li> 1 (8 ounce) package uncooked egg noodles </li>

        <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce, or as needed </li>

        <li>1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained </li>

        <li>1 (2.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained </li>

        <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced pepperoni, coarsely chopped </li>

        <li>20 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="topic"> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>

        <li>Cook the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until no longer pink, breaking the meat apart into
            crumbles as it cooks, about 10 minutes. </li>

        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the egg noodles in the boiling water until
            cooked through yet slightly firm, about 5 minutes; drain. </li>

        <li> Mix the noodles with the cooked ground beef, spaghetti sauce, black olives, mushrooms, pepperoni, and 1/2 of
            the mozzarella cheese in a large mixing bowl. Spoon the mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish and top with
            remaining cheese. Cover the dish with foil. </li>

        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is bubbling, 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
